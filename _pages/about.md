Hello! My name is Chris and I'm from Long Island, New York.

I have been developing software professionally for 3+ years and have a wide range of interests, skills, and experience ranging from data science to web development (and sometimes even a little of both).

Ever since I was a kid, I have been incredibly passionate about science and technology. With a BSc in Physics from Stony Brook University, I have a strong analytical and engineering background and am constantly expanding my technical expertise.

I am always open to new opportunities (both local and remote), let's get in touch! Feel free to email me (chris@christophergreening.com) or contact me on one of the listed social media platforms.
