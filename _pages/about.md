Hello! My name is Chris and I'm from Long Island, New York.

I have been developing software professionally for 3+ years and have a wide range of interests, skills, and experience ranging from data science to web development (and sometimes even a little of both).

With a passion for science and technology, I am always striving to diversify my skillset and learn new things.
